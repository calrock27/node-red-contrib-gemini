Project Brief: Node-RED Gemini API Integration (node-red-contrib-gemini)
Core Project Goal
To create a comprehensive, production-quality Node-RED package that provides a set of nodes for interfacing with the most of the Gemini family of models. 

The package must be publishable to the Node-RED Palette Manager and prioritize ease of use, adhering to all Node-RED design best practices.

Gemini API Docs: https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs

The entire project must be built using the latest version of the official Node.js SDK: @google/genai. https://github.com/googleapis/js-genai

If node-red is already running, restart the service every time you make a change to the code. 

Be sure to follow the general structure of any existing code when making any code changes or additions.
